# Feat: Feed Reader Testing in Jasmine
This project is a series of test suites written using *Jasmine*. The actual feed
reader application was already written and provided by *Udacity* as a target to
write tests against. The Jasmine icon and footer that are present are part of
the *Jasmine* interface.

# To Run This Project
Download the files and open the *index.html* file in a browser. The tests will
automatically resolve and pass. In order to see a test fail, change some data in
the *app.js* file in the *js folder*. For example, deleting a **URL value** from
the **url key** in the *app.js* file and then **saving and reloading** the page will
cause a failure in the first test suite and it will change from **green** to
**red**.

# Directions
This is a *non-interactive* project as far as testing functionality goes. The
testing takes place automatically when the page is loaded.

Once the feeds load however, feel free to follow the articles and learn some things or
just experiment with the functionality of the webpage.
